# 🛒 E-Commerce Sales Insights Using SQL


This project demonstrates how SQL can be used to extract valuable business insights from raw e-commerce data involving customers and orders.

I have divided the queries into **Basic**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced** levels to showcase depth in SQL knowledge and practice across core topics such as:

- Joins
- Aggregations
- Window functions
- Subqueries
- CTEs
- Data cleaning and transformation
